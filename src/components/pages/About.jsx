              Greetings! I'm Alexsander, a passionate individual originally from Brazil
              and currently residing in the vibrant state of New Jersey, USA.
              My journey is fueled by a deep commitment to becoming a skilled Full Stack Developer.

              I am always open to networking, collaborating, and learning from
              like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out if you share a passion
              for web development, technology, or simply want to connect with someone on a similar journey.
